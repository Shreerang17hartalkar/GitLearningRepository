## Why we use Git ?
  -->Git as we know is a **version control** system. We use git to help us track changes we made to our projects to make it easy to backtrack if we made any mistakes.
  
   Since Git is used to track changes, we want to keep the *commit history* as clean as possible. This means we try not to commit files that can introduce unnecessary conflicts. We also try not to commit files that arenâ€™t needed by the project.

## A file should be ignored if any of the following is true.
         1. The file is not used by our project.
         2. The file is not used by anyone else in our team.
         3. The file is generated by another Process.

 Lets take a look at common types of files we would ignore:
         
           1. Operating system files.
           2. Application files.
           3. Language and framework files.
           4. Files downloaded with package managers.
