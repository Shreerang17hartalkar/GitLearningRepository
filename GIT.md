##1)What is a Git Repository ?
-->A Git Repository is a virtual storage of your Project.It allows to save versions of your code,which you can access when needed.

##2)What is a Working Copy ?
-->GIT makes no distinction between a **Working Copy** and **Central Repository**,they are all full-fledged *Repositories*.Git's Collaboration model is based on *repository-to-repository* interaction.

##3)Git Cloning:
 If a Project has already been set up in a central repository **Git Clone** command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy.Git Clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make clone or a copy of that repo ina new directory,at another location.As a convenience,cloning automatically creates a remote connection called "Orgin" pointing back to the original repository.
 
 
##4)What is Branch in Git ?

 --->A **Branch** in Git is simply a lightweight movable Pointer to the commits.The default branch name in git is **Master**.When you are working on a project.you are going to have different features or ideas in progress at any given time.SOme of which are ready to go & others which are not.When you create a new *Branch* in your project,you are creating an environment,where you can try out new ideas.Changes you make on a *Branch* dont affect the master branch,so you are free to experiment and commit changes.
 
##5)Pull Request:
-->**Pull Requests** let you tell others about the chnages you have pushed into Repository.Once a pull request is sent,interested parties can review the set of changes.

##6)What is Git Merge?
-->Incorporates changes from the named commits(since the time their histories diverged from the current branch)into the current branch.This command is used by git Pull to incorporate changes from another repository.
